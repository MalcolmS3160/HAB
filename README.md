# HAB
High altitude balloon project for Bergen's 2018 STEM program

## Setting up your development environment

1. Clone this repo.
2. Install the Arduino IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software
3. Open the repo in the IDE

You may need to install some additional libraries. To do that, go to the Tools menu in the Arduino IDE, search for the missing libraries, and hit the install button.

## Building the code

In the Arduino IDE, hit the checkmark button at the top of the window (or select Verify/Compile in the Sketch menu). This will make sure the code compiles correctly and will give some information at the bottom of the screen such as how much storage the compiled binary will take up on the device, and how much dynamic memory will be available for the program after global variables are taken into account.
